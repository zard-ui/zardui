## October 2025 - Major Icons Migration, CLI updates, new components and docs upgrade

This month brings a **major breaking change** with the complete migration from `lucide-static` to `lucide-angular`, significant CLI improvements with theme support and multi-package manager compatibility, plus three powerful new components.

## üöÄ Major Update: Icons Migration (Breaking Change)

### Migration from CSS icon classes to lucide-angular

We've completely migrated all components from CSS-based icon classes to `lucide-angular` for **significantly better performance** and Angular optimization. This is a breaking change that requires action from users.

**Why this change?**
- ‚ö° **Better Performance**: Native Angular components instead of CSS icon fonts
- üéØ **Tree-shaking**: Only icons you use are bundled
- üîÑ **Better Integration**: Proper Angular lifecycle and change detection
- üì¶ **Smaller Bundle Size**: Dynamic imports reduce initial load
- üé® **Better Customization**: Full control over icon properties

**What you need to do:**

If you're using ZardUI icons in your project, you need to update from CSS classes to lucide-angular components:

```typescript
// ‚ùå Old way (CSS classes)
@Component({
  template: `<div class="icon-home"></div>`
})
export class MyComponent {}

// ‚úÖ New way (lucide-angular)
import { LucideAngularModule, Home } from 'lucide-angular';

@Component({
  imports: [LucideAngularModule],
  template: `<lucide-angular [img]="HomeIcon" [size]="20" />`
})
export class MyComponent {
  readonly HomeIcon = Home;
}
```

Or using ZardUI's icon component:

```typescript
import { ZardIconComponent } from '@zard/components/icon';
import { Home } from 'lucide-angular';

@Component({
  imports: [ZardIconComponent],
  template: `<div z-icon [zType]="HomeIcon"></div>`
})
export class MyComponent {
  readonly HomeIcon = Home;
}
```

**About Beta Status:**

As we're still in **beta**, we're continuously improving our documentation and components based on feedback from our community. Changes like this may happen during the beta phase as we optimize the library. Once we reach **version 1.0**, breaking changes will be much more controlled and follow semantic versioning strictly.

**Need Help?**

We're **100% committed** to helping with this migration! If you encounter any issues or need assistance:

This change sets the foundation for better performance and a more maintainable codebase going forward.

## ‚ú® New Components

### Sidebar Component

A collapsible Layout component with smooth transitions and customizable width.

```angular-ts
import { LayoutComponent } from '@shared/components/layout';
```

### Sheet Component

A versatile sheet component for side panels and overlays with customizable positioning and animations.

```angular-ts
import { ZardSheetService } from '@zard/components/sheet';

export class MyComponent {
  private sheetService = inject(ZardSheetService);

  openSheet() {
    this.sheetService.create({
      zTitle: 'Edit profile',
      zDescription: `Make changes to your profile here. Click save when you're done.`,
      zContent: ZardDemoSheetBasicInputComponent,
      zData: {
        name: 'Matheus Ribeiro',
        username: '@ribeiromatheus.dev',
      } as iSheetData,
      zOkText: 'Save changes',
      zOnOk: instance => {
        console.log('Form submitted:', instance.form.value);
      },
    });
  }
}
```

### Empty Component

A clean empty state component for displaying "no data" scenarios with customizable messages and actions.

```angular-ts
import { ZardEmptyComponent } from '@shared/components/empty';

@Component({
  template: ` <z-empty zImage="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/antfincdn/ZHrcdLPrvN/empty.svg" /> `,
})
export class DataViewComponent {}
```

## üì¶ Multi-Package Manager Support

The CLI now **automatically detects and supports** npm, pnpm, yarn, and bun. No configuration needed - just use your preferred package manager and the CLI adapts automatically.

## üé® CLI Theme Support

The CLI now includes **interactive theme selection** during initialization. Choose from multiple pre-built themes to kickstart your project with the perfect style.

### Available Themes

```bash tab="npm" copyButton
npx @ngzard/ui init
```

```bash tab="pnpm" copyButton
pnpm dlx @ngzard/ui init
```

```bash tab="yarn" copyButton
yarn @ngzard/ui init
```

```bash tab="bun" copyButton
bunx @ngzard/ui init
```

When you run the init command, you'll see:

```bash
‚úî Choose a theme for your components:
  ‚Ä¢ Neutral (Default)
  ‚Ä¢ Stone
  ‚Ä¢ Zinc
  ‚Ä¢ Gray
  ‚Ä¢ Slate
```
